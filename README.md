**Instructions on how to operate this program**

If you obeserve the CS303Assignment2.cpp file, you can see that I have left comments for what every output should do.
When you run this program, the terminal is the entire testing of this program. All you have to do is compare the output to the desired output
I have listed in the main, and it is nicely grouped together in neat testing sections for both the list (Q1) and the stack (Q2)

Here are pictures of the terminal output:
